Regression
Supervised machine learning techniques involve training a model to operate on a set of features and predict a label using a dataset that includes some already-known label values. There are lots of machine learning algorithms for Supervised learning, and they can be broadly divided into two types:

Regression algorithms: Algorithms that predict a y value that is a numeric value, such as the price of a house or the number of sales transactions.
Classification algorithms: Algorithms that predict to which category, or class, an observation belongs. The y value in a classification model is a vector of probability values between 0 and 1, one for each class, indicating the probability of the observation belonging to each class.

Description
Context Buying and selling used smartphones used to be something that happened on a handful of online marketplace sites. But the used and refurbished phone market has grown considerably over the past decade, and a new IDC (International Data Corporation) forecast predicts tThe global refurbished and used mobile phones market is projected to increase from US$ 49.9 Bn in 2020 to US$ 143.8 Bn by 2031, expanding at a CAGR of 10.2% during the same period.

 This growth can be attributed to an uptick in demand for used smartphones that offer considerable savings compared with new models.
Refurbished and used devices continue to provide cost-effective alternatives to both consumers and businesses that are looking to save money when purchasing a smartphone. There are plenty of other benefits associated with the used smartphone market. Used and refurbished devices can be sold with warranties and can also be insured with proof of purchase. Third-party vendors/platforms, such as Verizon, Amazon, etc., provide attractive offers to customers for refurbished smartphones. Maximizing the longevity of mobile phones through second-hand trade also reduces their environmental impact and helps in recycling and reducing waste. The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak may further boost the cheaper refurbished smartphone
